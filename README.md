Google Music Cache Tagger
==================================

This is a small java program that will tag your offline music.

It assumes that you've already pulled your cache from your phone.

If you don't have external store on your phone:
	'adb pull /data/data/com.google.android.music/ .'
	
If you do have external storage on your phone:
	'adb pull /sdcard/data/com.google.android.music/ .'
